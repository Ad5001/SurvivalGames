###How to use

#####How to create an arena
**1.** Teleport yourself in the world where you would like to create it (not default one).<br/>
**2.** Now you can use the command `/sg create [SWname] [slots] [countdown] [maxGameTime]` to create an arena.<br/>
**3.** Go back in the arena world and depending on its spawns/slots use the command `/sw setspawn [slot]` x times.<br/>
**4.** Place a sign with `sw` in the 1st line and `SWname` in the 2nd.<br/>
**5.** Done, now players can tap the sign to join the game!
